Developing and maintaining the Sleipnir constrained optimization problem solver and tools based on it.

## Projects

[Sleipnir](/Sleipnir) — A linearity-exploiting sparse nonlinear constrained optimization problem solver that uses the interior-point method.

[TrajoptLib](/Choreo/api/trajoptlib/cpp) — This library is used to generate time-optimal trajectories for FRC robots.

[Choreo](/Choreo) — A graphical tool for planning time-optimized trajectories for autonomous mobile robots in the FIRST Robotics Competition.
